FontGen
=======

A simple utility application that takes a TTF file and converts it
into a .pgm along with a text file describing which character maps to
which coordinates.

Arguments:

TTFFILE: filename of the .ttf (or any other format supported by freetype)

SIZE: size of the font (in pixel?!)

BORDER: an border that is left around each glyph, useful when one
wants to add effects such as shadow or a black border

IMAGEWIDTH: width of the resulting image

IMAGEHEIGHT: height of the temporary image (ugly, but needed at the moment)

UNICODES: optional list of characters that shall be generated, default is the whole font

# EOF #
